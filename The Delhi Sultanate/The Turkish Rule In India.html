<h1> <i> <u> turkish rule in india</u></i></h1>
<font size="5"> <font color="red"> When Muhammad Ghori died in 1206ce, he left no heir behind. His territories were divided into four areas left in the hands of his turkish slaves. The region of Delhi was given Qutbuddin Aibak ho fouded the <b>Mamluk Dynasty</b>. The word <b>'mamluk'</b> means slave. We have a variety of literary sources for this period, including <i>Minhaj-us-Siraj's Tabakat-i-Nasiri, Ziauddin Barani's Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi, Islami's Futuh-us-Salatin </i>and the writings of the Moroccan traveller Ibn Batuta.</font>
