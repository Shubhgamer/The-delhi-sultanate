<font size="4px"> <font color="red"> The founder of the Khiji dynasty, Jalaluddin Khilji, was already very old when he ascended the throne. Moreover, he had to spend most of his time suppressing internal rebellions. In 1296 ce, he was assassinated by his nephew, Alauddin Khilji, who became the sultan. </font> <br>
<font size="5"> <font color="blue"> <b> <br> Alauddin Khilji (1296-1316 ce) </b> </br></font>
<font size="4px"> <font color="red"> Alauddin Khilji was the first Turkish sultan to build an empire in India. He was a brilliant general and a shrewd administrator. Under him, the Delhi Sultanate witnessed a period of territorial expansion. His first campaign was against Gujarat. He may have been attracted by its tremendous wealth and the prosperity of its maritime trade. Alauddin then went on to sieze Malwa in the west, Ranthambore, Chittor and Jalore in Rajasthan.<br>
In 1306 ce, Alauddin invaded Devagiri in the Deccan. The campaign was led by his trusted general, <b>Malik Kafur</b>. Devagiri was easily defeated adn annexed. As a result, Malik Kafur was given the charge of all the southern campaigns. His armies went on to subdue Warangal and the Hoysala kingdom. The campaign earned the Sultanate a huge booty. Alauddin did not bring al these territories under his direct control. Their rulers accepted him as their superior and paid tributes to him.<br>
Alauddin Khilji kept the nobility under his control with the help of his spy system. He was against excessive indulgence and unbanned wine parties among the nobles. He himself stopped drinking wine. He died in 1316 ce. His death hastened the end of the Khilji dynasty and paved the way for the rise of the Tughlaqs.</font> <br>
