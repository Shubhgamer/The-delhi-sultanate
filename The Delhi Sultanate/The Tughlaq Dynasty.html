<h1> <i> <u> the tughlaq dynasty  </u></i></h1>
<font size="5"> <font color="blue"> <b> <br> Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq (1320-24 ce) </b> </br></font>
<font size="4px"> <font color="red"> Ghiyasuddin attained the throne in 1320ce. To improve the state's finances, he encoraged agriculture and tried to increase the land under cultivation. He also added Telangana, Jajnagar and Bengal to his kingdom. He died in 1324 ce and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad bin Tighlaq. <br>
<font size="5"> <font color="blue"> <b> <br> Muhammad bin Tughlaq (1324-51 ce) </b> </br></font>
<font size="4px"> <font color="red"> Muhammad bin Tughlaq was a scholar. He as intrested in logical, grammar, science and literature. He had a deep sense of justice and an open mind. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's empire included the Deccan the southern states, Odisha and Bengal. Lets us now look at some measures understand by Muhammad bin Tughlaq and how they affect the people. He is remembered for his decision to shift the capital from Delhi to Devagiri, which he renamed <b> Daulatabad </b>. Hewever, instead of just shifting the administration, he forced the entire population of Delhi to shift as well. Many people died due to the difficult journey and the capital too had to be shifted back two years later. Another experiment that the sultan introduced was that of token currency. Token coins were made of copper and could be exchanged with gold  and silver coins from the treasury. However, people began forging the copper coins in large numbers for exchange. Hence, the token currency system was abandoned.<br> When Muhammad bin tughlaq died in 1351 ce, the empire was on the way to its collapse. During his reign, many revolts had taken place in different areas. The size of the empire was so big that he was unable to control it. Communication was also poor. Though the Sultan had a visionary outlook, he failed to ensure proper execution of his ideas. He was succeeded by his cousin, Firoz Shah Tughlaq. <br>

<font size="4px"> <font color="red"> Firoz Shah's main aim was to consolidate the kingdom. He thus undertook measures to reform the administration. He built nearly 300 towns and repaired old buildings. He built the city of <b>Firozabad</b> in Delhi. He was a learned man and patronized scholars like Barani and Shams-i-Siraj Afif. Both nobles and common people were happy during his reign. His death in 1388 ce led to many rebellions. His successors were unable to stop the decline of the Tughlaq empire. </font>
