<font size="5"> <font color="blue"> <b> <br> Qutbuddin Aibak (1206-10ce) </b> </br></font>
<font size="4px"> <font color="red"> Qutbuddin Aibak took over Muhammad Ghori's terretories in India in 1206 ce. The kingdom established by him came to be called the <b>Delhi Sultanate</b>. Qutbuddin was the sultan or king for four years. Aibak was known as '<b>Lakh Baksh</b>' or the giver of hundreds and thousands. He was also a keen builder. He began the constructionof the famous Qutb Minar and the Quwwatul Islam Mosque. He died in 1210 ce due to an  accident while playing polo. The Turkish sultans had to face many problems. There were repeated <b>Mongol attacks</b> from the north-west. The Rajputs and other defeated rulers tried to regain thier independence. There were many coflicts among the turks themselves. Iy took these sultans nearly 100 years to secure their position in northern India before trying to expand their empire in the Deccan.</font><br>
<font size="5"> <font color="blue"> <b> <br> Iltutmish (1210-36ce) </b> </br></font>
<font size="4px"> <font color="red"> Qutbuddin Aibak was succeded by his son-in-law, Iltutmish. Historians regard Iltutmish as the <b>first real ruler</b> of the Delhi Sultanate. During his reign, Iltutmish first re-established control over territories that had slipped out of Turkish hands after Aibak's death. When the Shah of Persia was being pursued by the Mongol ruler, <b>Chenghiz Khan</b> , he fled towards India in search of selter. Iltutmish politely refused to give him refuge and thus, saved his kingdom from the danger of a Mongol invasion. He also won over the Turkish nobles by giving them territories. Iltutmish defeated and seized the Rajput kingdom of Ranthambore, Mandor, Jalor, Bayana, Thangir. He made Bihar and Bengal part of the Sultanate by crushing the revolt there. Before his death in 1236 ce, he nominated his Razia as his successor.</font><br>
<font size="5"> <font color="blue"> <b> <br> Razia Sultan (1236-39ce) </b> </br></font>
<font size="4px"> <font color="red"> Though Razia was appointed as the sultan by Iltutmish, the powerful nobles at the court were unable to accept a women as the ruler.Some say that nobles were extremely jealous of the high position occupied by Yaqut,Razia's Ethiopian slave. The nobles rebelled against Razia and she was overthrown and killed. </font><br>
<font size="5"> <font color="blue"> <b> <br> Ghiyasuddin Balban (1265-87ce) </b> </br></font>
<font size="4px"> <font color="red"> Razia's death was followed by a struggle for power between a group of powerful Turkish nobles called the <b>Chahalgani</b> or <b> the Forty Nobles</b>. One of the prominent member of this group was <b>Balban</b>. Though Raziawas succeeded by his brother <b>Nasiruddin Mahmud (1246-65 ce)</b>, the younge prince was inexperienced. Balban established himself as the real power behind the throne and overcame the opposition of the other nobles. Having established himself in a position of power, he declared himself to be the sultan in 1265 ce. <br> Balban ruled with an iron fist. His first task was to break the power of the Chahalgani group and establised himself as the supreme authority. He set up efficient spy system to ensure the everyone was loyal to him. He also increased the power and prestige of the monarch by introducing ceremonies like prostration before the monarch. Balban died in 1287 ce and his successor were weak and incompetent. The throne of Delhi was captured by a noble called <b>Jalaluddin Khilji</b>, who led the foundation of the <b>Khilji Dynasty</b>.
